# TypeScript Challenges

## About
This repository is an attempt to get better at Typescript. 

I'll be adding:

- implementation of [these challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro/)
- some tools from [this book](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)
- solving some data-strucutes and algorithms based challenges as well.

Languages used - Typescript(mostly), Javascript(seldom).

> Note: Most of the longer comments in the code are a note to self, if possible dont dwell on them.
